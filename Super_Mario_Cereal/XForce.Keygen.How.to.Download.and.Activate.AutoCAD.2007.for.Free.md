## Tips and Tricks for AutoCAD 2007

- Use grips and dynamic input to modify objects interactively. For example, you can use grips to stretch, rotate, scale, etc., objects without entering commands. You can also use dynamic input to enter values and options on the screen without using the command line.
- Use templates and standards to maintain consistency and quality of your drawings. For example, you can use templates to set up your drawing settings, such as units, layers, styles, etc. You can also use standards to check and correct any deviations from your predefined rules.
- Use blocks and external references to reuse and manage your data. For example, you can use blocks to create symbols and components that you can insert multiple times in your drawing. You can also use external references to link other files to your drawing without copying them.
