However, to use AirServer on your PC, you need an activation code that unlocks the full features of the software. An activation code is a unique serial number that verifies your purchase and grants you access to AirServer updates and support. Without an activation code, you can only use AirServer for a limited time as a trial version.
 
So how can you get an AirServer activation code for PC? There are two ways: either buy it from the official website or use a free generator tool. In this article, we will explain both methods and help you choose the best option for your needs.
 
## Buy AirServer Activation Code from Official Website
 
The easiest and safest way to get an AirServer activation code for PC is to buy it from the official website. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Go to [https://www.airserver.com/](https://www.airserver.com/) and click on "Buy Now".
2. Select the license type that suits your needs. You can choose between a single license for one PC ($19.99), a 5-pack license for five PCs ($79.99), or an unlimited license for unlimited PCs ($199.99).
3. Enter your email address and payment details. You can pay with PayPal or credit card.
4. Check your email for the confirmation message and the activation code. You will also receive a download link for the software.
5. Download and install AirServer on your PC.
6. Launch AirServer and enter the activation code when prompted.
7. Enjoy using AirServer on your PC!

By buying an AirServer activation code from the official website, you will get a lifetime license that includes free updates and support. You will also be able to use AirServer on multiple devices with the same activation code, as long as they are on the same network.
 
## Use Free Generator Tool for AirServer Activation Code
 
If you don't want to spend money on an AirServer activation code for PC, you can try using a free generator tool that claims to provide valid codes for free. However, we do not recommend this method for several reasons:

- Most of these tools are fake or scams that may infect your PC with malware or steal your personal information.
- Even if you find a working tool, the codes it generates may not work or may be already used by someone else.
- Using a free generator tool may violate the terms and conditions of AirServer and result in legal consequences or account suspension.
- You will not get any updates or support from AirServer if you use a free generator tool.
- You will not be able to use AirServer on multiple devices with the same code if you use a free generator tool.

Therefore, we advise you to avoid using free generator tools for AirServer activation code for PC and stick to the official website instead.
 
## Conclusion
 
AirServer is a great software that lets you mirror your mobile device to your PC. However, to use it fully, you need an activation code that unlocks all its features. You can either buy an activation code from the official website or use a free generator tool. However, we recommend buying an activation code from the official website as it is safer, more reliable, and more convenient than using a free generator tool.
